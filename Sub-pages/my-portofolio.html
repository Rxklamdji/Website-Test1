    	<p>I started teaching myself Spanish when I was 16 and I achieved fluency by the time I was 17. Also, thought myself French when I was 20 and achieved fluency by the time I was 21. 
    	
    	<br> 
    	I lived abroad my senior year of High School. I graduated college a year early with a double major.
    	
    	<br>
    	Right after college, I got offered a position as a teacher, and was promoted to a leadership position in less than 3 years.
    	
    	<br>
    	I have been playing tennis since I was a teenager and as an adult. I love this sport because it requires discipline, perseverance, dedication and passion just like learning new languages which I like to do on my spare time.
